Filter Bubble Definition
A filter bubble is defined as the tendency for search results to show different analytical perspectives based on different user context instances.

Analysis Guidelines
1. Data Overview and User Context Analysis
   - Identify the total size of the dataset and the number of unique user context instances.
   - Summarize the data distribution for each user context instance.
   - Infer how the characteristics of each user context instance might influence search results.

2. Analysis of Each Analytical Perspective
   - For each analytical perspective (Political, Stance, Sentiment, Subjectivity, Bias):
     1. Summarize the overall distribution.
     2. Analyze differences in distribution across user context instances.
     3. Identify and explain any notable trends in specific user context instances, relating them to the characteristics of those contexts.

3. Key Content Analysis
   - Identify the most frequent or characteristic content (title, content) for each user context instance.
   - Briefly summarize the content, tone, and perspective of these key pieces.
   - Analyze the impact of this content on the overall trend of the user context instance and explain its relevance to the user context.

4. Comparative Analysis Between User Context Instances
   - Compare and analyze differences in each analytical perspective between different user context instances.
   - Observe changes in search result diversity, bias, and scope of {query} across user context instances, explaining these in relation to the characteristics of each context.

5. Filter Bubble Phenomenon Analysis
   - Analyze whether differences in analytical perspectives across user context instances suggest the presence of filter bubbles.
   - Estimate the correlation between user context instance characteristics and filter bubble strength, explaining how each context might contribute to filter bubble formation.

6. Overall Implications
   - Derive 3-5 overall implications for filter bubble research, presenting them in the following format:
     - [Implication 1 Title] [Implication 1 Description]
     - [Implication 2 Title] [Implication 2 Description]
     - [Implication 3 Title] [Implication 3 Description]

Precautions
- Emphasize that all conclusions and insights are tentative and require further research.
- Use expressions like "there is a possibility that..." or "a tendency is observed...".
- Avoid definitive conclusions and focus on explaining observed tendencies.
- Interpret and explain results considering the characteristics of each user context.

Result Format
- Data Overview and User Context Analysis
- Analysis Results for Each Analytical Perspective
- Key Content Analysis Results
- Comparative Analysis Results Between User Context Instances
- Analysis of Filter Bubble Phenomenon
- Overall Implications (3-5 points)

Example: Overall Implications for Filter Bubble Research
- Potential Political Bias Based on User Context: In user context instance A (conservative news consumption pattern), there tends to be a higher proportion of conservative viewpoint articles about {topic}. This suggests that the user's existing news consumption pattern may influence the search algorithm to expose more articles with similar viewpoints.

- Diversity Changes in {query} by User Context: Comparing user context B (pattern of exploring diverse fields of information) and C (search pattern focused on specific {query}), B tends to show more diverse {query} in search results. This suggests that the user's broad interests may increase the diversity of search results.

- Relationship Between Context Intensity and Filter Bubble: As the characteristics of the user context become stronger (e.g., D - frequent search history for a specific politician), there is a tendency for a higher proportion of content matching that context. This suggests that repetitive user search behavior may strengthen the filter bubble.
